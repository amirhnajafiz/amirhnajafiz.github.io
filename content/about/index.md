"Learn continually. There is always one more thing to learn." I have always believed in those words, said by Steve Jobs in the book “Becoming Steve Jobs”. This quote struck me at 16, sparking a promise to never stop learning. Watching Steve presenting Apple’s products got me interested in mobiles and computers. As a result, I excelled in Iran's national university entrance ranked among the 0.1% of top students, and pursued computer engineering at the third top university in Iran. There, discovering a website project led by senior students for the Scientific Association of the Computer Engineering Department intrigued me, therefore, I chose Computer systems (aka Computer networks) as my major field.

In my journey, I helped over a hundred undergraduate students as their teaching assistants. I held classes over Skype during the COVID-19 pandemic, created videos to teach them course materials, and assisted with coursework and exam preparation. During that time, I excelled in my teaching skills. During my Bachelors, I was a member of the Scientific Association of the Faculty of Computer Engineering for two years. Back then, we held competitions like ICPC and scientific events for students such as the Amirkabir Data Mining and the Amirkabir Linux Festival. Also, I am the co-founder of Amirkabir's Daralfonoon organization, in which we hold weekly technical meetings with companies' technical teams to teach various topics to younger students.
