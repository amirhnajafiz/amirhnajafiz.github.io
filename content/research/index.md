For the past 4 years, my research has focused on Cloud computing and Distributed systems. So, for my Bachelor’s project, I worked on creating an automated system to perform penetration testing over a cloud environment. This project was under the supervision of Prof. Sadeghian.

Besides my Bachelor’s project, I worked with Dr. Charmchi from the University of Rennes; We worked on a project to design customized distributed caching systems and our goal was to increase their hit ratio alongside load balancing.

Moreover, I was the head member of a research project under the supervision of Prof. Javadi to implement a Linux kernel module named QJUMP over NIC to improve its network interface card performance by jumping its queue when the network input load is high.

To continue my research, I attended an internship at Snapp (Iran Uber) company, which is also the biggest start-up in Iran, as a software and cloud engineer in their platform team. I maintained distributed infrastructure systems and built operators to automate operations on the platform. While working there, I learned soft skills like team collaboration, leadership, time management, and project management.
