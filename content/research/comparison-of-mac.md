In Data communications between system in a local area network, medium access control 1 protocols are mechanisms for allowing several users to transmit their data into a common medium or channel 2. But when multiple users want to access a same channel at a same time there will be "colliding" and data losses. Therefor we need a mechanism to control the channel so that users can send their data without any colliding. Scheduling is an approach to control the channel and it comes with three major methods, reserve system, polling, and token ring. In this paper we are going to compare these methods to see which one is better to use. Medium Access Control Switched networks provide interconnection between users by means of transmission lines, multiplexers, and switches. The transfer of information across such networks requires routing tables to direct the information from source to destination. To scale to a very large size, the addressing scheme in switched networks is typically hierarchical to help provide location information that assists the routing protocol in carrying out its task. Broadcast networks, in contrast, are much simpler. Because all information is received by all users, routing is not necessary. A nonhierarchical addressing scheme is sufficient to indicate which user the information is destined to. However, broadcast networks require a medium access control protocol to orchestrate the transmissions from the various users. Local area networks (LANs), with their emphasis on low cost and simplicity, have been traditionally based on the broadcast approach. In this chapter we consider medium access control protocols and local area networks. We also consider the access methods used in cellular radio networks.
