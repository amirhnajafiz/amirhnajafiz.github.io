Hacking computer memory 1 with C programming language, but how is this even possible? In this article we are going to hack our system memory with C programming language to generate a buffer overflow attack in the system, but before doing that we are going to talk about what is buffer overflow and how it can make vulnerabilities for our applications or system. We are going to talk about what is actually happening when buffer overflows and then we are going to talk about its consequences. In the next parts we are going to access to other parts of memory with C programming language by giving an example with real code and then talk about how does C programming language allow us to access every part of memory? How we can secure our system against this problem? What will happen if we don't come with a solution to control this vulnerability? Why can't we access to any part of memory in other programming languages like Java and Go 2 ? What makes a programming language safe against buffer overflow attack? After reading this research you will know everything about buffer overflow attack and how to stop it.
