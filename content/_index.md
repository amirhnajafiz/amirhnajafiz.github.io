    # A description for the paper.
    description: The radioactive element astatine exists only in trace amounts in nature. Its properties can therefore only be explored by study of the minute quantities of artificially produced isotopes or by performing theoretical calculations. One of the most important properties influencing the chemical behaviour is the energy required to remove one electron from the valence shell, referred to as the ionization potential.

I am 22 years old and look forward to graduating in February 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology.
For the past 4 years, my research has focused on Cloud computing and Distributed systems. So, for my Bachelorâ€™s project, I worked on creating an automated system to perform penetration testing over a cloud environment. To continue my research, I attended an internship at Snapp (Iran Uber) company, which is also the biggest start-up in Iran, as a software and cloud engineer in their platform team. I maintained distributed infrastructure systems and built operators to automate operations on the platform. While working there, I learned soft skills like team collaboration, leadership, time management, and project management.
