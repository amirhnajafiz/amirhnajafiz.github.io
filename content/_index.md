    description: Moving high priority packets to the front of the network interface card (aka queue jumping). Our goal is to create a kernel module to perform this approach on our local system's NIC. In this repository we present this module's code-base. In the next sections we are going to describe this module by presenting 4 steps that its taking.

I am 22 years old and look forward to graduating in February 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology.
For the past 4 years, my research has focused on Cloud computing and Distributed systems. So, for my Bachelorâ€™s project, I worked on creating an automated system to perform penetration testing over a cloud environment. To continue my research, I attended an internship at Snapp (Iran Uber) company, which is also the biggest start-up in Iran, as a software and cloud engineer in their platform team. I maintained distributed infrastructure systems and built operators to automate operations on the platform. While working there, I learned soft skills like team collaboration, leadership, time management, and project management.
