          <p class="text-justify">
            I am a Computer Science PhD student at Stony Brook University.
            I am a member of the File Systems and Storage Lab (FSL) and I am advised by Prof. Erez Zadok.
            My research interests are in distributed systems, cloud computing, and storage systems.
            I am currently working on designing distributed, secure and reliable clusters for running machine learning applications.
            This envolves setting up runtime applications like OpenShift and Kubernetes on top of CephFS, NFS, and other distributed file systems.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Before starting my PhD, I worked as a full-time Cloud Engineer at Snapp company for three years. During this time, I gained valuable experience in cloud and software engineering.
            I developed VoIP and CEMQ services and managed OpenShift clusters.
            My responsibilities included cluster orchestration, operator management, monitoring, and application delivery services.
            At that time, I also was completing my undergraduate studies at the Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
          I have always been fascinated by computer systems.
          My journey began in my first year of undergraduate studies when I started developing websites using WordPress.
          This initial interest in web development soon expanded to software and infrastructure.
          During my bachelor's degree, I realized that university alone wasn't enough to satisfy my curiosity, so I decided to gain practical experience by joining the industry.
          After some time, I sought new challenges and applied to Stony Brook University, where I was accepted.
          I am passionate about cloud computing, computer networks, programming languages, and storage systems.
          My favorite programming language is Golang, and I enjoy using Notion for organizing my work.
          I am constantly engaged in building new things or learning about the latest advancements in technology.
